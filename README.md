Development Process
Initial Blueprint (a.html):

A basic HTML file (a.html) was created to outline the structure and design of the webpage.
The rough HTML included placeholders for each section and basic layout features.
React Component Creation:

The rough HTML was translated into reusable React components.
Components such as ConnectStore, CustomProductsSection, and ProfitCalculator were created.
Styling with Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS was used to style the components for quick and efficient design.
Vercel Deployment:

The final app was deployed to Vercel for fast performance and easy sharing of the project.
Future Enhancements
Add Routing: Implement React Router for more pages.
Dynamic Product Catalog: Fetch product data using an API.
Interactive Profit Calculator: Allow users to input their own product prices and costs.
SEO Optimization: Improve visibility on search engines by adding metadata.
